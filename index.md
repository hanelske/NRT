Hello I'm a thing{: .notice--success}

The New Robotic Telescope (NRT) is a [Liverpool John Moores University](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk) project in collaboration with the [Instituto de Astrof√≠sica de Canarias (IAC)](https://www.iac.es) and the [National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand (NARIT)](http://www.narit.or.th/en/). 

Following the on-going success of the 2-metre fully autonomous and robotic [Liverpool Telescope (LT)](http://telescope.livjm.ac.uk/), the NRT will be a 4-metre facility, co-located with the LT on La Palma, designed for rapid-response, time-domain astronomy. The project is currently in the design phase, with an on-sky target date of 2023. A combination of light-weight mirror technology and advanced material science will allow the NRT to slew to any part of the sky and be observing a target within 30 seconds.
