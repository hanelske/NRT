The New Robotic Telescope (NRT) is a Liverpool John Moores University project in collaboration with the Instituto de Astrof√≠sica de Canarias (IAC) and the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand (NARIT).

The NRT will be a 4-metre fully autonomous, robotic telescope designed for rapid-response, time-domain astronomy. The project is currently in the design phase, with an on-sky target date of 2023.
