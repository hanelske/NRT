* 4-metre diameter primary mirror.
* Rapid slewing to targets within 30 seconds of receipt of trigger.
* To be located on La Palma, Canary Islands.
{: .notice--info}

The New Robotic Telescope (NRT) is a [Liverpool John Moores University](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk) project in collaboration with the [Instituto de Astrof√≠sica de Canarias (IAC)](https://www.iac.es) and the [National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand (NARIT)](http://www.narit.or.th/en/). 

Following the on-going success of the 2-metre fully autonomous and robotic [Liverpool Telescope (LT)](http://telescope.livjm.ac.uk/), the NRT will be a 4-metre facility, co-located with the LT on La Palma, designed for rapid-response, time-domain astronomy. The project is currently in the design phase, with an on-sky target date of 2024. A combination of light-weight mirror technology and advanced material science will allow the NRT to slew to any part of the sky and be observing a target within 30 seconds.

The Liverpool Telescope is accessible to all through a variety of routes (see the [LT website](http://telescope.livjm.ac.uk/PropInst/Phase1/) for more details), this model will also be adopted by the NRT (with different time splits depending on project collaborators). The NRT team are looking for partners/contributors to the project, if you are interested in getting involved please contact our [project team](/_pages/team.md) directly, or alternatively send us an email using the form below and we'll get back to you.
