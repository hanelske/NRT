The New Robotic Telescope (NRT) is a Liverpool John Moores University project in collaboration with the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) and the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand (NARIT).

The NRT will be a 4-metre fully autonomous, robotic telescope designed for rapid-response, time-domain astronomy. The project is currently in the design phase, with an on-sky target date of 2023.

#Welcome to the new webpage for the Liverpool New Robotic Telescope (NRT); a collaboration between Liverpool John Moores University and the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias. The [design team](_pages/team.md), established in early 2018, are in the process of finalising the engineering and science requirements of the [facility](_pages/telescope.md). The NRT [science case](_pages/science_case.md) details the science drivers for the project; the NRT team welcome ideas and contributions across the astronomy community. To get in touch see our [design team](_pages/team.md) page.

#The [news](news.md) page details the latest project developments including workshops, meetings, partners and outreach.
