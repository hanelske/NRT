# Ground-breaking rapid robotic follow-up with a 4-metre successor to the Liverpool Telescope

Welcome to the new webpage for the Liverpool New Robotic Telescope (NRT); a collaboration between Liverpool John Moores University and the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias. The [design team](team.md), established in early 2018, are in the process of finalising the engineering and science requirements of the [facility](telescope.md). The NRT [science case](science_case.md) details the science drivers for the project; the NRT team welcome ideas and contributions across the astronomy community. To get in touch see our [design team](team.md) page.

The [news](news.md) page details the latest project developments including workshops, meetings, partners and outreach.
