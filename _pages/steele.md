I am the LT Director and Head of the Technology Group at ARI, LJMU.  I obtained my PhD in observational infrared astronomy from the Univeristy of Leicester in 1994, and then worked as a Research Fellow at the University of Southampton until 1996 when I moved to LJMU to work on the original robotic telescope project.  My research interests include novel astronomical instrumentation, especially polarimetric and spectroscopic, as well as observational work on a wide range of time variable phenomena including GRBs, Be stars, blazars and exoplanets.  Although I am from Newcastle upon Tyne, I have absolutely no interest in football!
