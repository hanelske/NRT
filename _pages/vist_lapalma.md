o the trip was from the 25 - 28 June. The first day at the IAC we met the 3 new engineers and Dr Carlos Gutierrez. We met for lunch, a tour of the IAC on Tenerife and a meeting (of which IAS and yourself joined in via zoom or skype). 

Second day was spent in La Palma. We went up the mountain - SB and myself did some upkeep on the LT (fold mirror cleaning and IR analysis). We then all went on a trip of several observatories, notably the WHT, GranTeCan and the Carlsberg Meridian - where the NRT will be. 

We ended up meeting all sorts of people, such as the ING director Marc Barcells and the architect on La Palma responsible for the NRT site and plans. 

At the end of the day, when all the boys were very tired, they got on a plane and went back to Liverpool.
