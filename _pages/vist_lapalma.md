On 25th June staff from LJMU visited the Canary Islands. The first day was spent in Tenerife meeting Asier Oria Carreras, Juan José Sanabria Cumbreño, Miguel Ángel Torres Gil and Dr. Carlos Gutierrez of the IAC. Following a tour there was a board meeting, with participants from LJMU contributing via videolink.

The second day was spent in La Palma. Some maintenance work was carried out on the LT and the team visited observatories, including the William Herschel Telescope, GranTeCan and the Carlsberg Meridian Telescope - the proposed site for the NRT. The teams met with the ING director Marc Barcells and the architect to discuss the NRT site and plans.
