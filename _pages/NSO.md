## The Schools' Observatory

The Liverpool Telescope exceeds at public outreach and schools engagement through the [Schools' Observatory](https://www.schoolsobservatory.org/), who are also part of the Astrophysics Research Institute at Liverpool John Moores University. Established in 2004, the Schools' Observatory has a mission to enable **access to the Universe for all** and have created a website to allow children and other interested members of the public to access data from the LT by submitting request through an online 'Go Observing' graphical user interface. 

Many of the images requested by school children have been enhanced by astrophotographers Wim van Berlo and Goran Nilsson and can be viewed on the [LT flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/149839008@N02/albums/72157686412640266/with/35722140881/). One of these stunning images of the Bubble Nebulae appeared on [NASA's 'Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)'](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180205.html) on 5th February 2018.
