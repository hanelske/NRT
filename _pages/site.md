The New Robotic Telescope (NRT) will be co-located with the current Liverpool Telescope (LT) on the Canary Island of La Palma. The proposed site for construction is the disused Carlsberg Meridian Telescope site, close to the William Herschel Telescope (WHT). 

The La Palma location will be complementary to the specialized observing roles being adopted by the ING telescopes with WEAVE delivering statistically complete catalogues of object populations and NRT delivering follow-up of variable and the rare objects not well suited to the massively multiplexed WEAVE model. It will play a key role in monitoring the Northern transient sky (many sources of transients are all sky e.g. Gaia, GWs, GRBs or Northern e.g., ZTF, CTA-N, IceCUBE etc.). La Palma is also sufficiently equatorial that many LSST targets will be visible for ~4-6 hours per night. Co-location with the GOTO GW counterpart finder and the current LT (which we planto transition to a wide field survey/transient detection machine) also adds value. The La Palma site therefore offers considerable scientific synergies and opportunities, combined with its logistical and cost advantages due to its relatively nearby location and well developed existing infrastructure.
