The New Robotic Telescope (NRT) will be co-located with the current Liverpool Telescope (LT) at Roque de los Muchachos on the Canary Island of La Palma. The proposed site for construction is the disused Carlsberg Meridian Telescope (CMT) site, close to the William Herschel Telescope (WHT). La Palma is an ideal location for the NRT as it is one of the best sites in the Northern Hemisphere (second only to Maunakea, Hawaii). The presence of the LT affords many advantages: the site is familiar to the LT team and co-location simplifies logistics. There is already an established workshop at the LT site, and the former CMT site has existing infrastructure in place. The collaboration with the IAC is vital, and our connections with existing Spanish construction and utilities companies allow a smoother progression through the project.

The La Palma location will be complementary to the specialized observing roles being adopted by the Isaac Newton Group (ING) telescopes with WEAVE (multi-object spectrograph for the William Herschel Telescope) delivering statistically complete catalogues of object populations and the NRT performing follow-up of variable sources and the rare objects not well suited to the massively multiplexed WEAVE model. The NRT will play a key role in monitoring the Northern transient sky (many sources of transients are all sky: Gaia, gravitational wave candidates from aLIGO/Virgo, Gamma-ray Bursts or Northern hemisphere: Zwicky Transient Factory, Cherenkov Telescope Array-North, IceCUBE etc). La Palma is also sufficiently equatorial that many Large Synoptic Survey Telescope targets will be visible for ~4-6 hours per night. Co-location on La Palma with the GOTO gravitational wave counterpart finder and the current LT (which we plan to transition to a wide field survey/transient detection machine) also adds value. The La Palma site therefore offers considerable scientific synergies and opportunities, combined with its logistical and cost advantages due to its relatively nearby location and well developed existing infrastructure.
