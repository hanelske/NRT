## Rapid response robotic telescope
Building on the success of the fully autonomous and robotic [Liverpool Telescope](http://telescope.livjm.ac.uk/), the design of its 4 metre successor is underway. The focus is on fast follow-up of rapidly varying and fading transients, including gravitational wave candidates and new and exciting objects, which are anticipated to be discovered in the new upcoming era of survey telescopes. The next decade will see the commissioning of many major international projects, opening new windows on the time-variable universe. They will make it possible to search wider areas of the sky than ever before, and as such discover new classes of transient and time-variable sources at optical, radio and high-energy Gamma-ray wavelengths and exploiting multimessenger and particle physics too. There is a critical need for a new 4.0m optical follow-up facility to rapidly respond to such discoveries and make detailed photometric, spectroscopic and polarimetric observations.

## Optical design

The NRT is designed for rapid follow-up of transient objects (see the [Science Case](science_case.md) for full details). The 4-metre diameter mirror will enable the exploration of fainter sources and shorter exposure times (and thus increased cadence monitoring) of transient and variable objects.

The baseline optical design that has been developed for the facility is a Ritchey-Chr√©tien telescope with a 4-metre primary mirror of focal ratio = f7.5. The design uses an f1.75 primary mirror and a back focal distance of 2.5m; allowing sufficient optical path length to provide possible Nasmyth (along with Cassegrain) foci and to allow for the mechanics of the tube, mirror support and instrumentation. The mirror design is still in discussion, with 6-segment (plus spare) and monolithic designs having a variety of advantages and disadvantages. 

## Mirror design

A 6-segment hexagonal or petal design would allow easier removal of segments, more regular maintenance, less down-time and are lighter than a monolithic mirror. Seven identical segments would be used in rotation, allowing the telescope to continue observing during recoating without needing to go offline. A monolithic mirror would also be a single point of failure; if it were to be damaged in the removal/recoating process there is no back-up. A monolithic mirror ideally requires a crane fixed to the dome for removal. The current LT enclosure does not allow for a fixed crane, so an external crane is required.

The monolithic design of course offers the simplest route to excellent image quality, as no phasing or co-aligning is required. Without the gaps between segments it is possible to explore the Infrared without additional heat from behind the mirrors affecting sensitivity. The only active optics consideration for a monolithic mirror is the alignment of the primary and secondary mirrors, whereas for a segmented design there is the additional complexity of co-aligning (ensuring all the mirrors are aligned so that overlapping images appear to come from a single telescope) and phasing (very accurate alignment that allows the mirrors to function as a single surface). Co-aligning is a much simpler process than phasing, but does not exploit the potential resolution of the 4-metre mirror, if the segments are co-aligned but not phased, the angular resolution is just that of a single segment.

Segmented mirrors require complicated software to co-align or phase the mirrors, such technology has never been exploited fully autonomously and thus poses new challenges. The mirror supports required to accurately align/phase the mirrors also add additional weight, which may result in a segmented design being comparative in weight to a monolithic mirror (which has a simpler mirror support system). In addition, the rapid slew of the telescope may require more frequent mirror alignment/phasing, which could increase overheads for each observation, although the mechanical challenges of rapidly slewing a 4-metre monolith mirror are substantial. The key driver of the NRT is to rapidly acquire the target and obtain good data as quickly as possible. This aim is at the core of our design decision making process.

## Enclosure design

The iconic clamshell enclosure of the Liverpool Telescope allows the telescope to rapidly slew across the sky arriving at the target of interest within minutes, without waiting for dome rotation, it also removes any effects from dome seeing. It does, however, leave the telescope vulnerable to wind shake, and delicate instrumentation housed on the telescope Cassegrain can be exposed to Calima (the hot, dry dust that comes from the Sahara). For the new facility the design team are exploring the possibilities of dome or enclosure structures.
