On 27th September, project partners from LJMU and the IAC visited Spanish industrial company [Asturfeito](https://www.asturfeito.com/) in Oviedo, Spain. Asturfeito have been building the 400 tonne telescope mount assembly for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) in their factory in northern Spain, and as part of collaborations with the University of Oviedo, the NRT project partners visited the factory for a tour.
