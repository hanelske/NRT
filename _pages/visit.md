On 27th September, project partners from LJMU and the IAC visited Spanish industrial company [Asturfeito](https://www.asturfeito.com/) in Oviedo, Spain. Astufeito have been building the 400 tonne telescope mount assembly for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in their factory in northern Spain. Adrian McGrath, Iain Steele and Helen Jermak from LJMU, along with Rafael Rebolo, Carlos Gutierrez and Miguel Torres Gil from IAC, visited Asturfeito Project and General Managers Ricardo Rodr√≠guez and Francisco Romero to view the telescope mount assembly and to discuss Asturfeito's involvement in the NRT project.

As part of the visit, the team held an NRT board meeting where they presented the latest developments of the project and discussed the current design concepts and tolerancing.
