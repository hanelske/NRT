The [design team](_pages/team.md), established in early 2018, are in the process of finalising the engineering and science requirements of the [facility](_pages/telescope.md). The NRT [science case](_pages/science_case.md) details the science drivers for the project; the NRT team welcome ideas and contributions across the astronomy community. To get in touch see our [design team](_pages/team.md) page.
